# Project Outline:

In this group project, Higgs dataset (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HIGGS) is analyzed in several steps:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing using Preprocess module.
2. Feature Engineering by creating new features using Featuretools package (https://www.featuretools.com/) and feature selection methods. This methodology is done using Features module.
3. Fitting XGBoost, Catboost, and LightGBM models, and comparing optimized models against each other.
4. Comparing the models with AutoML of GCP.
