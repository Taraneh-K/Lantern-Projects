# Pima Indians Diabetes Analysis
This dataset provides us with information of diabetes diagnosed or not based on the number of pregnany times, glucose, bp (blood pressure), skin (skin thickness), insulin, bmi, pedigree, age. 

## Analysis Outline:
1. Data Exploration
2. Fitting a Neural Network Model suggested by instructor
3. Examining a methodology to optimize the model parameters and hyper parameters: Using Grid Search to optimize all the parameters at a same time
4. Examining orthogonalization methodoloy to optimize the model parameters and hyper parameters: Using Grid Search to optimize the important parameters separately in a sequence. As the next steps, ROC curve of the model was improved by adjusting the threshold.
5. Examining model performance using only important features
