# Application of Dash to create a dashboard from Plotly graphs and deployment on GCP

This project follows several steps:

1. Recorded health data (Sleep, Exercise, Steps count, Floors Climbed, Heart Rate, Stress level) of a person was analyzed and Plotly was used to create dynamic charts. The complete analysis can be found in: https://github.com/Taraneh-K/Lantern-Projects/tree/master/Health_Project
2. Dash enabled us to view few selected Plotly graphs in a web page.
3. Finally, Dash web page was Deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The required files for deployment are all added to this folder.
