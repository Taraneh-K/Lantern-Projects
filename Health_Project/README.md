# Health_Project
In this project, health data of a person recorded by a device was analyzed. These data include the data recorded during sleep and exercise. It also measures number of steps, floors climbed, heart rate and stress of the person. Overall approach of this project is as following:

1. Data Cleaning of each dataset

2. Adjusting the times based on the time offset (for datasets which are not in local time)

3. Analyzing each dataset separately

4. Merging 2 or more datasets for further analysis, finding meaningful correlations, and developping models

5. Implementing Machine Learning tools to develop models

6. Selecting few Plotly graphs, make a dashboard, and deploying the web app on GCP (it can be found in https://github.com/Taraneh-K/Deploy_Dash_Project)
